## Google Prep Plan ##

I will spend time preparing for Google's technical interview process. Even if I don't get it, I should be fine getting accepted at another good tech company. Google is notorious for Graph and DP hard problems in their new grad interviews, so mastering those will be a big focus of my preparation. I am also going to spend some time on System Design interview problems.
