## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is often used for OPTIMIZATION problems

We can use a top-down approach where we iteratively fill a matrix for solutions to subproblems and use those subproblems to solve the given question
Atlernatively, we can use MEMOIZATION where we store previously answered subproblems in a matrix/map to avoid solving subproblems more than once. Memoization solutions are usually recursive or utilize DFS.
