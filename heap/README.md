# Heap #
Heap is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node. Then it is called a Min Heap. If each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node then it is called a max heap. It is very useful is implementing priority queues where the queue item with higher weightage is given more priority in processing.

## Use cases
- 'Top K' problems
- Scheduling Tasks or CPU scheduling problems
